Thu Sep 14 16:05:51 EDT 2023 Getting universal chromosome/contig prefix ...
          Querying ../pop_structure/Tzo.A.ssl.Tzo-C-0402G-R1R2-contam-noisolate.Fltr07.18.rename.vcf ...
          Prefix: NODE
          It is assumed that all values in the CHROM column of vcf begin with NODE
          If this is not the case, then fltrVCF will not work properly.
          The prefix is used to count SNPs/variants, contigs, etc and is used in some filters.
