Fri Jul 23 18:16:05 EDT 2021 Getting universal chromosome/contig prefix ...
          Querying lle.B.ssl.Lle-C-3NR-R1R2ORPH-contam-noisolate-off.Fltr07.14.vcf ...
          Prefix: NODE
          It is assumed that all values in the CHROM column of vcf begin with NODE
          If this is not the case, then fltrVCF will not work properly.
          The prefix is used to count SNPs/variants, contigs, etc and is used in some filters.
