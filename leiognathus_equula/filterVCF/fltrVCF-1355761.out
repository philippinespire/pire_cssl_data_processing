	Output file prefix is set to 'Leq.A'
	The number of threads is set to '40'
	-P not set by user. Only filters that natively support parallelization will be run in parallel.
	Leq.A.rad.RAW-2-2.Fltr07.18.vcf will be used for serial processing.

Wed Mar 22 14:02:53 EDT 2023 Getting universal chromosome/contig prefix ...
          Querying Leq.A.rad.RAW-2-2.Fltr07.18.vcf ...
          Prefix: dDocent
          It is assumed that all values in the CHROM column of vcf begin with dDocent
          If this is not the case, then fltrVCF will not work properly.
          The prefix is used to count SNPs/variants, contigs, etc and is used in some filters.
