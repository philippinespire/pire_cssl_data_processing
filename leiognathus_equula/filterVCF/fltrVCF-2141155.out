Wed Aug 23 11:39:00 EDT 2023 Reading options from config file and setting defaults
	SETTINGS are being loaded from file: 'config.fltr.ind.cssl.HWE'
	Filters are set to '18 17'
	CutoffCode is set to '.rad.RAW-2-2'
	BAM_PATH is set to '../mkBAMmerge'
	SCRIPT_PATH is set to '../../scripts/fltrVCF/scripts'
	VCF_FILE is set to '../pop_structure/Leq.A.rad.RAW-2-2.Fltr07.18.rename.vcf'
	Bed file is set to '../mkBAMmerge/mapped.rad.RAW-2-2.bed'
	Reference genome is set to '../mkBAMmerge/reference.rad.RAW-2-2.fasta'
	PopMap is set to 'popmap.rad.RAW-2-2.HWE'
	HWE_SCRIPT is set to '../../scripts/fltrVCF/filter_hwe_by_pop_HPC.pl'
	RADHAP_SCRIPT is set to '../../scripts/rad_haplotyper/rad_haplotyper.pl'
	Output file prefix is set to 'Leq.A'
	The number of threads is set to '40'
	-P not set by user. Only filters that natively support parallelization will be run in parallel.
	../pop_structure/Leq.A.rad.RAW-2-2.Fltr07.18.rename.vcf will be used for serial processing.

Wed Aug 23 11:39:01 EDT 2023 Getting universal chromosome/contig prefix ...
          Querying ../pop_structure/Leq.A.rad.RAW-2-2.Fltr07.18.rename.vcf ...
          Prefix: dDocent
          It is assumed that all values in the CHROM column of vcf begin with dDocent
          If this is not the case, then fltrVCF will not work properly.
          The prefix is used to count SNPs/variants, contigs, etc and is used in some filters.
