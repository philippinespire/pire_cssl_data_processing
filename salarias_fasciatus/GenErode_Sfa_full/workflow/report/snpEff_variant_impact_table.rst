Numbers of SNPs with high, moderate, low, and modifier impact for each sample.

- HIGH: The variant is assumed to have high (disruptive) impact in the protein, probably causing protein truncation, loss of function or triggering nonsense mediated decay. 	Examples: stop_gained, frameshift_variant  
- MODERATE: A non-disruptive variant that might change protein effectiveness. Examples: missense_variant, inframe_deletion  
- LOW: Assumed to be mostly harmless or unlikely to change protein behavior. 	Examples: synonymous_variant  
- MODIFIER: Usually non-coding variants or variants affecting non-coding genes, where predictions are difficult or there is no evidence of impact. Examples: exon_variant, downstream_gene_variant
