I have multiple fltrBAM dirs because making a beagle file from all >600 individuals was taking too long.

Thus, I created sub-dirs:

fltrBAM				# all individuals
fltrBAM_fewTest			# 3 best alb/comt of each population
fltrBAM_HamMat                  # all individuals from Hamilo cove and Matnog Bay
fltrBAM_fewHamMat		# 3 best alb/comt from Hamilo cove and Matnog Bay

I am running mkBGL anf fltrVCF in each sub-dir as well.
