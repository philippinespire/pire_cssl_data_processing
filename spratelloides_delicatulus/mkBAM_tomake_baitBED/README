I am trying to calculate the coverage for the bait regions. 

For this, I need a bed file for the baits but since Sde was one of the first species to be processed with probes, arborbio did not send us a bed file.

I am generating one:
1. found the bait sequences, Bird_Final_Baits_GC_55-36_choosen_baits.fas
2. converting Bird_Final_Baits_GC_55-36_choosen_baits.fas to Sde_choosen_baits.fq with fasta_to_fastq.pl
 (https://code.google.com/archive/p/fasta-to-fastq/)
 (https://code.google.com/archive/p/fasta-to-fastq/downloads)
 Execute:
 perl fasta_to_fastq.pl Bird_Final_Baits_GC_55-36_choosen_baits.fasta > Sde_choosen_baits.fq
3. compressing to get Sde_choosen_baits.fq.gz format, gzip Sde_choosen_baits.fq
4. creating mkBAM_tomake_baitBED , following dDocent mkBAM as usual
