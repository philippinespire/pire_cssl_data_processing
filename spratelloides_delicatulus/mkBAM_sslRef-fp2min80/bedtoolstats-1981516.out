  You are loading a legacy bedtools module, please load a up to date module
instead:
  
    module load container_env bedtools
  
  Please run bedtools command with "crun.bedtools" prepend to it, for example:
  
    crun.bedtools bedtools
  
  Otherwise you will get "command not found" error. 
Parallel module is no longer necessary, please feel free to not load it,
parallel
command will still be available to you.
