For the merge files I followed Brendan's instructions for merging and naming files.

Yet, I later changed the name of files to include "clmp" so that the R script in metadata processing would parse the name correctly

```
for i in *merged.*; do mv "$i" "${i/\.rgfix-RG/-rgfix-L2-clmp-fp2-repr\.cssl\.Sde-CMat_087-RG}"; done
```
