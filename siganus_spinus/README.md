### 0. Rename files

Trying the re-vamped rename script. So far, does not seem to be working as intended.

```
cd /home/e1garcia/shotgun_PIRE/pire_cssl_data_processing/siganus_spinus/raw_fq_capture
bash /home/e1garcia/shotgun_PIRE/pire_fq_gz_processing/renameFQGZ.bash Ssp_CaptureLibraries_SequenceNameDecode.tsv
```
